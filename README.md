Day.ly is a service created for university students who would like to have a one-stop hub for all of their upcoming due-dates, deadlines, discussions, and chats. This weekly planner is designed to gather information from the many services that the JHU community uses. The service can gather assignment information (including a title, a due date/time, and the course information) from Blackboard and Gradescope, while delivering message notifications from GroupMe and Slack.
